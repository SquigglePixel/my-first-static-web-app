                <h3>Packrafting</h3>
                <p>
                    The Gila Region is home to a high density of perennial streams, as compared to most other areas within the arid Southwest, making packrafting the perfect mode of transportation to explore this remote and scenic wilderness destination. GAILS is proud to offer beginner – intermediate instruction, guided overnight clinics and equipment rentals to support your paddling adventures!

                <h3>Llama Trekking</h3>
                <p>
                    The GAILS rancho has been home to three “Classic” pack llamas for over a decade now. These sure-footed camelids are fully trained for panier-style packing and can carry 75-100 lbs. of gear per animal. Visitors and campers can hang out, photograph and hand feed them or enroll in ½ - full day clinic on handling and packing techniques.

                <h3>Traditional Fly or Tenkara Fishing</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether you are interested in learning technique or just getting out to bag the elusive native Gila Trout, GAILS is ideally situated to explore the proximate waters, with the heart of Gila trout habitat being the Gila and Aldo Leopold Wilderness Areas. The once endangered species are beautiful, resilient, and a pleasure to angle for, as much a part of the region's character as the Gila River itself.

                <h3>Disc (Frisbee) Golf</h3>
                <p>
                    The GAILS property boasts a private 15-hole disc golf course that plays across the San Fransisco River and spans the entire 6-acre rancho property.  While the course lacks official driving pads and signage, every “hole” utilized PDGA approved chain-style baskets.  The evolving layout is truly one of the more unique and scenic disc golf courses you will ever play!  Cost summary = $5 greens fee or free with other services (donations for maintenance always welcome).
